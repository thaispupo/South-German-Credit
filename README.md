Data Set Information:

The widely used Statlog German credit data as of November 2019, suffers from severe errors in the coding information and does not come with any background information. The 'South German Credit' data provide a correction and some background information, based on the Open Data LMU (2010) representation of the same data and several other German language resources.


Attribute Information:

This section contains a brief description for each attribute. Details on attribute coding can be obtained from the accompanying R code for reading the data or the accompanying code table, as well as from Groemping (2019) (listed under 'Relevant Papers').
